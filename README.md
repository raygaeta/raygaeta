Hi there! Welcome to My GitHub! ðŸŒŸ
Here, you'll find my contributions to open-source neurotechnology projects and creative coding repositories that combine my passions for creative technology, human biology, visual experiences, and data.

With a Bachelor of Science in Biology and a strong foundation in programming, Iâ€™m driven by the potential of merging human biology and creative technology to create visually stunning, data-driven interfaces that enable the full potential of human-computer interaction.

I believe that beautifully designed graphical interfaces are key to making complex data accessible and intuitive. Whether itâ€™s creating interactive tools to visualize neural activity or crafting immersive experiences that bridge the gap between humans and machines, Iâ€™m excited to contribute to technologies that shape the future of neurotech and beyond.
